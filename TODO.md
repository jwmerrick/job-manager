# ROADMAP

## v0.8.4 -> Branch `feature/preview`
Implementing a job list and job post preview function.
Will be especially helpful in figuring out if you've got the template setup right.

Complete:
[X] When accessing Job List Frontend, "Attempt to read property ID on null in frontend-shortcodes on Line 90, 92 for /jobs/

To-Do:
[ ] RSS Endpoint, Enable / Disable in Admin settings, shortcode for RSS (It's in the code, but not documented)
[ ] Fatal error on Admin > Interviews
[ ] Use of deprecated get_currentuserinfo() in admin-comments.php, admin-emails.php, frontend-application.php, frontend-user.php
[ ] Do not flush rewrite rules on every page load

## v1.0.0 -> 
Add REST endpoint for integration with OpenCATS
Strip out Thomas Townsend / wp-job-manager.com references and links if Thomas no longer wishes to participate
